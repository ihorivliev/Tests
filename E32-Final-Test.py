#                      Existe: The Final Validation Suite
#
# This script constitutes a comprehensive, zero-tolerance formal validation
# of the core axioms and theorems of the "Existe: A Treatise on the Final
# Architecture of Reality".
#
# It moves beyond simple consistency checks to perform a battery of rigorous
# logical tests, including:
#   1. Ontological Integrity: Testing the biconditional nature of the
#      Universal Principle.
#   2. Geometric Soundness: Proving the necessary properties of the
#      part-whole relationship and complexity ordering.
#   3. Epistemological Coherence: Proving that perception is deterministic
#      and consistent across observers.
#   4. Identity & Combinatorics: A formal proof of the "Dissolution of the
#      Self" theorem.
#   5. Temporal Dynamics: A test for the logical coherence of the
#      "Reading-Path" to ensure a linear flow of time.
#
# Each test is designed to be adversarial where possible, attempting to
# prove a property by showing that its negation leads to a contradiction.
# A successful run of this entire suite provides the strongest possible
# evidence for the internal logical consistency of the treatise.
