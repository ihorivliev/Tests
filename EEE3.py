#                  Final Audit: The Rosetta Stone Protocol
#
# This script performs the ultimate stress test. It models a "Bi-Level Ontology"
# to determine if a system can support complex, paradoxical phenomena (like
# consciousness) without corrupting its own sound, logical foundation.
#
# TIER 1: The "Stone" - A static, rigid, classically-sound universe. We assert
#         the existence of the "sterile object" we successfully found previously.
#
# TIER 2: The "Scribe" - A dynamic "Observer" process that reads the Tier 1
#         substrate. We will allow this process to enter a state of true
#         contradiction (a paraconsistent state).
#
# THE BRUTAL TEST: Can the contradiction in Tier 2 ever cause a logical
# contradiction in Tier 1? A 'sat' result proves the "firewall" between the
# tiers holds, demonstrating that a universe can be both sound and complex.
