#
#                       The Rosetta Stone Simulator
#
# This script moves beyond static validation to a dynamic simulation. It uses
# the Bi-Level Ontology to propose and model a mechanism for a primitive
# form of consciousness.
#
# The simulation consists of:
#
# TIER 1 ("The Stone"): A fixed, timeless, and classically sound graph that
#         represents the ground truth of reality. We use the exact rigid
#         object discovered in our previous audit.
#
# TIER 2 ("The Scribe"): A dynamic process that traverses the Tier 1 graph,
#         creating a memory of its path over time.
#
# THE CONSCIOUSNESS EVENT: A special event that occurs when the Scribe's
#         dynamic, internal memory-trace is found to be structurally identical
#         to a static path that exists timelessly on the Stone. It is the
#         moment the observer's story finds itself written in reality.
