# Stage 5: Strengthening Fractality to Size-2 Subgraphs
# ------------------------------------------------------
# We extend Stage 4 by requiring fractality not only for single-node patterns
# but also for every pair of nodes. That is:
#   For every size-2 subgraph P = {i, j}, there exists a disjoint pair Q = {k, l},
#   k < l, Q != P, such that the induced subgraphs on P and Q are isomorphic
#   (same edges among them).
#
# We keep the previous axioms:
#   1. R: at least one edge
#   2. Acyclicity: no directed cycles
#   3. Weak Connectivity: undirected connectedness
#   4. Fractality (size-1): every node has a twin
#   5. Fractality (size-2): new requirement
#
# Domain: 4 nodes (0â€“3), brute-force all directed graphs without self-loops.
