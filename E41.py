#                    Existe: The Ultimate Logical Integrity Audit
#
#                            -- Zero Tolerance --
#
# This script represents the most rigorous and unbiased formal stress test of
# the "Existe" metaphysical framework. It operates in three stages:
#
# 1. Foundational Coherence: It first validates the basic logical machinery
#    (mereology, complexity) to ensure a fair and sound basis for testing.
#
# 2. Philosophical Formalization: It charitably formalizes the core, high-level
#    philosophical claims of the treatise as new, explicit axioms.
#
# 3. Adversarial Stress-Testing: It subjects the complete, integrated system
#    to a battery of adversarial proofs designed to find contradictions,
#    unintended consequences, and philosophical weaknesses.
#
# The verdict of this script is not a simple pass/fail, but a detailed
# analysis of the logical integrity of the "Existe" framework under maximum
# logical scrutiny.
